## Usage

Gromit allows you to set up your AWS infrastructure and automate deployment processes. Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to use it:

1. **Configure AWS Credentials**:
   Ensure your AWS credentials are set up. You can do this by creating a `~/.aws/credentials` file with the following format:
   ```ini
   [default]
   aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
   aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY
   ```

2. **Create a Terraform Configuration**:
   Create a Terraform file (e.g., `main.tf`) with your desired AWS resources.

3. **Run Gromit**:
   Execute Gromit to deploy your infrastructure:
   ```bash
   ./gromit apply
   ```

4. **Automate with GitHub Actions**:
   Create a GitHub Actions workflow file (e.g., `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) to automate the deployment process:
   ```yaml
   name: Deploy to AWS

   on:
     push:
       branches:
         - main

   jobs:
     deploy:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - name: Checkout code
           uses: actions/checkout@v2

         - name: Set up Go
           uses: actions/setup-go@v2
           with:
             go-version: '1.16'

         - name: Build Gromit
           run: go build

         - name: Deploy
           run: ./gromit apply
   ```
